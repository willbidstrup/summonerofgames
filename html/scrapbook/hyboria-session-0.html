    <h2>Hyborian Chronicles</h2>
    <h3>Session 0</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Hyborian Chronicles, where I explore the depths of virtual tabletop roleplaying and fan-fiction. <br>
      I will be chronicling my own adventures as a Doom Master and Developer, as well as the exploits of the characters. <br>
      Sessions will be run every week, and I imagine will be a solo expereince to start with, although once I am comfortable with the system I intend to invite a gaming group.<br>
